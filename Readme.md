Project build on **Visual Basic 6**

Database used: **Microsoft Access**

Year of Development: **2011**

*Time Table Management System* or *Routine Management System* for university classes build on Visual Basic 6. 

***my thoughts***

Most probably this was my first and last project on Visual Basic. 
I lost it when my desktop crashed few years ago and found a backup CD now.
I may not be able to resolve any issues you make on this project but would be happy if someone works out through the code.
I believe the project was up and running then, and only part not working was the print function.
