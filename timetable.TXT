The cab file for your application has been built as 'E:\Projects vb\setup\timetable.CAB'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (E:\Projects vb\setup\Support\timetable.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab file in case you make changes to some of the files.

You have included mdac_typ.exe in your installation package.  If you will be installing this package on a Windows 95/98 system, it will require DCOM98 to install properly.
